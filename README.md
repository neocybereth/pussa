# FOR RALPH USAGE:

## Files Required

### 1) ralph

### 2) PRD.md

### 3) progress.txt

1. `ralph` is just the bash loop that keeps spawning claude agents until they complete PRD.md
2. `PRD.md` is the markdown file where you describe what you want `ralph` to loop over. Typically what you do first is go to claude code and have it generate a plan for something you want to build and then use that in your `PRD.md`
3. `progress.txt` is left blank to start with and ralph will fill it up as it progresses.
